								<h4>Building A Website in GitHub Pages</h4>
								<p>
									Super psyched that I have discovered the GitHub Pages 
									which I  immediately created a account and now I am 
									testing it out.

								<h4>Python - Flask</h4>
								<p>
									Flask is a powerful Python Framework for Web Development which is 
									second to Django, another Python Web Development framework. From 
									what I heard Flask is more flexible than Django and thus influence 
									my decision to teach myself Flask. I have a fair grip on Flask.
									In time, I plan to create a Website Run by Python - Flask.
