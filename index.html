									<h4>Building A Website in GitHub Pages</h4>
									<p>
										Super psyched that I have discovered the GitHub Pages 
										which I  immediately created a account and now I am

									<h4>Python - Flask</h4>
									<p>
										Flask is a powerful Python Framework for Web Development which is 
										second to Django, another Python Web Development framework. From 
										what I heard Flask is more flexible than Django and thus influence 
										my decision to teach myself Flask. I have a fair grip on Flask.
										In time, I plan to create a Website Run by Python - Flask.
