                <p class="br-info-Text">
                    I have come a long way since first building this static website back in 2019 - 2020
                    while awaiting graduation from the <span class = "text-info">University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG)</span>. I have always been
                    intrigued in the field of Information Technology especial Telecommunication and thus
                    led me to major in <span class = "text-info">Physics (Computing and Electronics Division)</span> which I study for 3 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my years at the UPNG I was fortunate to take a course called 
                    <span class = "text-info">Introduction to Programming</span> where 
                    I start developing a passion for coding. I could still rememeber the 
                    feeling of writing my first <span class = "text-info">'Hello, World!'</span> 
                    code in <span class = "text-info">C++</span> and printing it out to the console. 
                    I had now moved on from C++ and now do a lot of my programming in <span class = "text-info">Python</span> 
                    which I love very much. I also did a course on Website Development which
                    I now love to code custom website including this website as my first project, and was fortunate 
                    enough to be trusted to develop my current company's website 
                    <a href="https://nexttowntech.com.pg">nexttowntech.com.pg</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I now have <span class="text-info">2+ Working Experience</span> as an <span class="text-info">Core Network & Application Officer</span>; 
                    I have developed skills in planning and organizing website projects, 
                    research and development of products, and planning and setting up networks 
                    for business enterprises and service providers. I have good understanding of cloud 
                    solutions and developing cloud products.
